## RAWDATA Assignment 4 – Web Service and Data Layer

This assignment is in two parts.

The first part is about creating a domain model and as data service. The data service is the layer that communicates with the database and provide an interface to the rest of the  system. The data service also takes care of the transformation between the database model and the domain model.

In the second part, a restful webservice is added in a layer on top of the data layer from the first part.
